# Case Classes Demo

Presented at the Atlanta Scala Meetup on May 18, 2016.

`Car.scala` is a plain old Scala code which can be compiled as usual.
`CarDemo.sc` is a scala worksheet which can be run from within IntelliJ. 

Decompiled output of all generated classes is located in `decompiled_ouput` directory

To see the decompiled output of the generated classes run:

`javap -cp <classpath of compiled classes> <name of class>`
